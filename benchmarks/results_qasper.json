        "we design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme for non-collaborative tasks. We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories.  In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme For specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.",

Anti-scam system's goal is to engage user in the conversation longer in order to limit their harm to other potential victims.
